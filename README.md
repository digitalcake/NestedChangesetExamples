# NestedChangesetExamples

This is meant to serve as an example of the many ways to address nested data sets in ecto.

I would like to learn the alternative ways to build associated data.

For this I will use the example of a `Contact` having many `Phone numbers`

While the context of a `Contact` having many `Phone numbers` maybe best addressed a different way
(IE: embeds_many ) I think it has the simplest context to highlight the task at hand.

For my first example I will show case a very basic common scenario for people just learning ecto, where I use `cast_assoc` in contacts changeset pipline to bind `phone_numbers`

This is done via the contact's changeset pipeline and only requires that I pass the nested changeset for phone numbers as a list like so.

iex(2)> Accounts.create_contact_with_cast_assoc(%{name: "foo", description: "bar", phone_numbers: [ %{number: "555-5555"}] })

It has been expressed by the community that this is not always the most favorable way to create associated data.

This repo is aimed to explore the alternatives.

Heres the example of how you could do this via Ecto.Multi

```
