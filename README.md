# NestedChangesetExamples

This is meant to serve as an example of the meany ways to address nested data sets in ecto.

I would like to learn the alternative ways to build associated data.

For this I will use the example of a `Contact` having many `Phone numbers`

While the context of a `Contact` having many `Phone numbers` maybe best addressed a different way
(IE: embeds_many ) I think it has the simplest context to highlight the task at hand.

For my first example I will show case a very basic common scenario for people just learning ecto, where I use `cast_assoc` in contacts to bind `phone_numbers`

This is done via the contact's changeset pipeline and only requires that I pass the nested changeset for phone numbers as a list like so. 


```
iex(1)> alias NestedChangesetExamples.Accounts
NestedChangesetExamples.Accounts
iex(2)> Accounts.create_contact(%{name: "foo", description: "bar", phone_numbers: [ %{number: "555-5555"}] })

It has been expressed by the community that this is not always the most favorible way to create assocated data. 

This repo is aimmed to explore the alternitives. 

Feel free to contribute your way of dealing with this simple task and submit a PR and I will add it to show case.
